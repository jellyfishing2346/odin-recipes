    <h2>Lasagna</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Lasagna is a typical rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions.
      </li>
      <li>Fun fact: 

      Did you know that the original version of Italian lasagna was vegetarian, despite the popularity of meat lasagna today? This recipe, dating back to the 13th century, was made with layers of pasta, spinach, eggplant, artichokes, ricotta cheese, and grated cheese. Meat was only introduced during the Renaissance, when lasagna began to spread outside Italy.

      In the 16th century, tomato sauce, a quintessential ingredient in Italian pasta, was added to this recipe with the arrival of tomatoes in Italy.
