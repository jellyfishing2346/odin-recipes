      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Wonderfully seasoned chicken with a crispy golden exterior, on top of tender pasta that’s coated with a velvety garlic and Parmesan cream sauce. What’s more, it looks and tastes like a gourmet meal, but it’s incredibly easy to make. Trust me, your entire family will love it!</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> Chicken breasts are seasoned and pan seared in olive oil and butter until moist on the inside, with a golden crust on the outside. We keep the seasonings simple with just salt, pepper, and our homemade Italian seasoning blend, since so much additional flavor comes from the cream sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Pasta:</strong> Pasta is cooked in salted water until al dente, which is the bed of this dish. A long, flat noodle like Fettuccine is perfect here, providing more surface area for the sauce to cling to. Linguini is another great choice, or penne which is able to catch the sauce in its ridges. Honestly though, any pasta works.</li>
        <li><strong>Alfredo Sauce:</strong> We used our favorite Alfredo Sauce recipe for this dish. Butter, heavy whipping cream, freshly grated Parmesan cheese, garlic, and seasonings come together in a matter of minutes for the most incredible white sauce that coats the cooked pasta. Heaven!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil the noodles:</strong> Cook the Fettuccine al dente, according to package instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the chicken: </strong> Season the chicken, then pan-fry in oil and butter, for 6 minutes a side, or until an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for a few minutes, then cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. Tent with foil, while you prepare the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Alfredo sauce:</strong> Using the same pan you used to cook the chicken, the cream, butter, and seasonings are incorporated and simmered on medium-low heat until thickened, then the Parmesan is added in until melted and smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Drain the pasta, reserving some of the liquid to loosen the sauce (only if necessary.) Toss immediately with the Alfredo sauce. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of cooked chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
      </ol>
